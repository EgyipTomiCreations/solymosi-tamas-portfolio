# 🌟 My Portfolio - Built with Next.js 🚀

Welcome to my personal portfolio site! This project was bootstrapped with [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org) and serves as a showcase of my work, skills, and projects. 💻✨

## 🎯 Getting Started

To get started with the development server, run:

```
npm run dev  # or yarn dev, pnpm dev, bun dev
```

Then, open [**localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the site. 🎨

## 🛠 Editing & Customization
